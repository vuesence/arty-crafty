          <li>A variant of the general layout of the web application</li>

          <li>General style/design options</li>
          <li>
            Separate functionality injected as functional fragments (API module, i18n, PWA, splash screen,
            auth module, themes, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>Ability to connect/integrate common libraries (including UI) if desired</li>
          <li>Possibility to integrate with certain headless CRM and other backend API services.</li>
